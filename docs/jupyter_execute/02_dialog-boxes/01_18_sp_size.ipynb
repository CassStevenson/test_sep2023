    "- **Large**:  bears or ungulates (i.e., large mammals with hooves, such as White-tailed deer, Elk, Moose, etc)\n",
    "- **Multiple**:  *select this option if your study includes multiple Target Species that vary in body size.*\n",

    "Body size affects the detection process ({{ ref_intext_obrien_et_al_2011 }}). Species with a larger body size are more likely to be detected; and therefore may require lower sampling effort than smaller species ({{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}). Larger species moving through the camera’s detection zone are more likely to trigger the camera ({{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}; {{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{ ref_intext_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}); they can also be detected farther away or occur at wider angles ({{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{ ref_intext_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}). Whereas, small mammals are often undetected due to their small size ({{ ref_intext_obrien_et_al_2011 }}; {{ ref_intext_anile_devillard_2016 }}) and because “small species which routinely move at fast speeds, such as stoats and weasels, are likely to have especially small detection zones” ({{ ref_intext_glen_et_al_2013 }}).\n",

    "When thinking beyond the camera's FOV, larger species generally also have larger home ranges ({{ ref_intext_garland_1983 }}) and daily movement distances, making them more likely to be detected at multiple cameras ({{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}), therefore there are also implications for which models may be appropriate (due to assumptions of “site closure” / “independent locations”).\n",
