    "[Unmarked individuals / populations / species]{#typeid_unmarked}\n",
    "  Individuals, populations, or species (varies with modelling approach and context) that cannot be identified using natural or artificial markings (e.g., coat patterns, scars, tags, collars). Unmarked population models rely on supplementary data (e.g., animal movement speed) and/or assumptions as a surrogate for individual identification; that is, to distinguish between multiple detections of the same individual from detections of multiple individuals when individuals do not have unique features (Gilbert et al., 2020; Morin et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "[User label]{#settings_userlabel}\n",
    "  A label (up to 16 characters) that can be programmed in the camera’s settings, and that will be visible in the data band of all photos and videos taken by the camera (Reconyx, 2018). It is recommended that users program the Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name as the user label, which serves as a means to confirm which Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name is associated with the images/videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "[*UTM Zone Camera Location*]{#utm_zone_camera_location}\n",
    "  The number corresponding to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid zone where the camera was placed (e.g., \"12”). UTM is a coordinate system that divides the earth into grid zones that are identified with a number (representing a width of latitude) and letter (representing the hemisphere).<br><br>In Alberta the UTM zones are either 11, 12, or TTM. Enter all other UTM zones in the Camera Location Comments field (e.g., zones 7-10 for British Columbia), or use Latitude and Longitude instead of UTM coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Video Length (seconds)*]{#settings_video_length}\n",
    "  If applicable, describes the camera setting that specifies the minimum video duration (in seconds) that the camera will record when triggered. Leave blank if not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Viewshed]{#fov_viewshed}\n",
    "  The area visible to the camera as determined by its lens angle (in degrees) and trigger distance (Moeller et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Viewshed density estimators]{#fov_viewshed_density_estimators}\n",
    "  Methods used to estimate the abundance of unmarked populations from observations of animals that relate animal observations to the space directly sampled by each camera’s viewshed (Moeller et al., 2023); they result in viewshed density estimates that can be extrapolated to abundance within broader sampling frames (Gilbert et al., 2020; Moeller et al., 2023).\n",

    "  When a crew has gone to a location to deploy, service, or retrieve a remote camera.\n",

    "  Comments describing additional details about the deployment and/or service/retrieval visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Visit metadata]{#visit_metadata}\n",
    "  Metadata that should be collected each time a camera location is visited to deploy, service or retrieve a camera. Other relevant metadata fields that should be collected differ when a camera is deployed vs. serviced or retrieved. <br/>Refer to Appendix A - Table A5, Camera Deployment Field Datasheet, and Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet.\n",

    "[Visual lure]{#baitlure_visual_lure}\n",
    "  Any material that draws animals closer via their sense of sight (Schlexer, 2008).\n",

    "[Walktest]{#walktest}\n",
    "  A test performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the \"Walktest Distance,\" e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height \\[i.e., the \"Walktest Height,\" e.g., 0.8 m\\]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).\n",

    "[**Walktest Complete*]{#walktest_complete}\n",
    "  Whether a walktest was performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the \"Walktest Distance,\" e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height \\[i.e., the \"Walktest Height,\" e.g., 0.8 m\\]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).\n",

    "[Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989)]{#mods_zinb}\n",
    "  A regression model used in the setting of excess zeros (zero-inflation) and overdispersion. This approach is a two-part model, where the zero-inflation is modelled separately from the counts and assumes that the count (abundance) is \"conditional\" on the zero-inflation model (occurrence) model. \\[relative abundance indices\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression (Lambert, 1992)]{#mods_zip}\n",
    "  A regression model for count data that both follows the Poisson distribution and contains excess zeros (Lambert, 1992). ZIP models are only appropriate for data for which the overdispersion is not solely due to zero-inflation. \\[relative abundance indices\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zero-inflation]{#mods_zero_inflation}\n",
    "  An excess of zeros that is \"so large that those expected in standard distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial and beta)\" (Heilbron, 1994) violate the assumptions of such distributions (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes can be a result of ecological effects (\"true\" zeros) or due to sampling or observer error (\"false zeros\") (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes contribute to overdispersion, but they don't necessarily account for all excess variability (Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019).\n",
