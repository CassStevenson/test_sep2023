    "A [deployment](#deployment) is a unique placement of a camera in space and time (recorded as \"Deployment Name\"). There may be multiple [deployments](#deployment) for one [camera location](#camera_location). [Deployments](#deployment) are often considered as the time between [visits](#visit) to a [camera location](#camera_location) (i.e., [deployment](#deployment) to service, service to service, and service to retrieval). Any change to [camera location](#camera_location), sampling period, camera equipment (e.g., [Trigger Sensitivity setting](#settings_trigger_sensitivity), becomes non-functioning), and/or conditions (e.g., not [baited](#baitlure_bait) then not [baited](#baitlure_bait) later; camera SD card replaced) should be documented as a unique [deployment](#deployment).\n",

This will allow users to more accurately determine failure dates. For example, it may be difficult to determine a failure date for a camera that is only occasionally [triggered](#trigger_event) by animals (e.g., on a weekly basis). Taking an image at a prescribed interval also provides a consistent record of site conditions over time (e.g., snow cover, vegetation growth).\n",

    "The date and time of the last image or video collected during a specific [deployment](#deployment) (e.g., \"27-Jan-2019 22:10:05\"). The [Image Set Start Date Time](#image_set_start_date_time) may not coincide with the [Deployment End Date Time](#deployment_end_date_time). Recording this field allows users to account for [deployments](#deployment) that were conducted but for which no data was found, and to confirm the last date and time a camera was active (if functioning) if no images or videos were captured prior to service/retrieval (especially valuable if users did not collect [time-lapse images](#timelapse_image) or if the camera malfunctioned).\n",

This field is important to record to confirm that no data has been lost during file transfers etc."
