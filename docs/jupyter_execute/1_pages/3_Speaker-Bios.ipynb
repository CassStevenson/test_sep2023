His focus on large mammals started with his PhD on Arctic grizzly bears in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories. His current work includes projects in Alberta and Atlantic Canada. His research is primarily focused on how animals use landscapes and how natural and human factors influence their behaviour, movements, and distribution across the landscape. His research is applied in nature with a focus on filling knowledge gaps for species that are of interest to many local groups. Currently, he is particularly interested in the influence predators such as wolves and black bears have on the Ronald Lake wood bison and on their fidelity to a large meadow complex in the northwest part of the herd’s range, and on how black bears use and co-exist with humans on industrial landscapes.\n",

Her thesis explores the use of remote wildlife cameras to obtain population demography of Dall’s sheep as compared to aerial surveys, with special interest paid to community and youth engagement throughout. Concurrent to her MSc, Sydney also co-authored BC’s Thinhorn Sheep Stewardship Framework as part of the Indigenous Perspectives working group.

For the last decade, he has worked collaboratively with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and non-profit organizations to monitor mule deer and other ungulates across Utah with GPS collars. This monitoring effort has involved capture and marking of more than 10,000 ungulates in Utah leading to a large and robust data set used to inform conservation and management efforts. These data have increased our understanding of ungulate ecology—primarily mule deer—leading to improved management of this species.

In her current role, Layla coordinates and identifies caribou research and monitoring priorities; designs and conducts fieldwork; analyses data and reports on research findings; participates in impact analyses for projects affecting woodland caribou individuals and critical habitat; and consults with public and stakeholders on caribou issues. She has worked with many collaborators on studying caribou and translating findings into improved wildlife and habitat management in Jasper National Park, including predator-prey studies, caribou population modelling, genetics, health, landscape ecology, and recovery options analyses. She has been a key collaborator in developing the concept for caribou conservation breeding.\n",
