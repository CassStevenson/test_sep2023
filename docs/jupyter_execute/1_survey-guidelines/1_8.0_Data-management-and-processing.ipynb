All data, including the images, [deployment area photos](#deployment_area_photos) and complete [metadata](#metadata), can be uploaded and stored in the [WildTrax repository](http://www.wildtrax.ca).

    "\n",
    "[Image classification](#image_classification) refers to the process of [assigning class labels](#image_classification) to an image according to the wildlife species, other entities (e.g., human, vehicle), or conditions within the image (e.g., snow presence or depth [Sirén et al., 2018]). [Image classification](#image_classification) can be performed manually or automatically by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm ([see section 8.2.4](#TOC_surv_guidelines_use_of_artificial_intelligence_megadetector)). [Classifying images](#image_classification) with AI is commonly used to filter images into relevant categories prior to [image tagging](#image_tagging) (Fennell et al., 2022). [Image classification](#image_classification) is sometimes used interchangeably with “image tagging.”\n",
    "\n",
    "[Image tagging](#image_tagging) is the process of characterizing wildlife species, other entities (e.g., human, vehicle), or conditions within an image. [Image tagging](#image_tagging) may follow [image classification](#image_classification) to further describe characteristics of individuals (e.g., [Age Class](#age_class), [Sex Class](#sex_class), [Behaviour](#behaviour)), entities within the image, or information about the conditions of the [camera location](#camera_location) (e.g., the [FOV](#field_of_view), presence of [bait](#baitlure_bait) or [lure](#baitlure_scent_lure)) or the environment (e.g., weather).\n",

    "### 8.3.3 Use of artificial intelligence (MegaDetector) \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved the efficiency and precision of [classifying camera images](#image_classification) (Fennell et al., 2022; Norouzzadeh et al., 2020; Tabak et al., 2018). [Microsoft's MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) (Beery et al., 2019) is the most used AI platform for this purpose. [MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) (Beery et al., 2019) is a free, open-source platform that [classifies images](#image_classification) as [false triggers](#false_trigger) (“EMPTY”), humans, vehicles or animals based on probability distributions. It indicates the [classification confidence](#image_classification_confidence) for each image, which can be used to filter [false triggers](#false_trigger) (or other unwanted) images from view based on the [confidence level](#image_classification_confidence). The remaining images can then be [tagged](#image_tagging) more efficiently. Studies of [MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md)’s performance in [classifying](#image_classification) images with humans and animals found it to have a higher accuracy rate than [classification](#image_classification) by human observers (99% vs 82%, respectively) and significantly faster processing times (500% higher and 8.4x less time) (e.g., Fennell et al., 2022). MegaDetector also had higher precision and recall when classifying images as ‘empty’ or ‘animal’ than some other AI platforms (Velez et al., 2023). Refer to Velez et al. (2023) for a comprehensive review of the requirements and advantages/disadvantages of MegaDetector relative to other platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before filtering out images, however, it is important to manually verify the [classification](#image_classification) of a sub-sample of images within each [classification](#image_classification) category ([false triggers](#false_trigger), humans, animals, vehicles). At least 5,000 auto-tagged images should be reviewed each year for each [classification](#image_classification) category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The online version of [MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) online does not currently [classify](#image_classification) animals according to species. However, researchers have developed models using [Megadetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) to “train” machine learning algorithms to [classify](#image_classification) species in some regions. Tabak et al. (2018) reported that their models were very accurate for a few more common species (over 97.7%) in their area-of-interest but markedly less accurate for rare species. Since species and ecosystems differ by region, pre-trained models are only applicable to the area in which they were developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) can also be downloaded and run on a Windows-based machine (most simply using [EcoAssist](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/EcoAssist#windows-installation) ([https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/EcoAssist\\\\#windows-installation](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/EcoAssist#windows-installation){.uri}), or images can be submitted to Dan Morris (see <https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.DownloadMegadetector> for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some software, such as [Timelapse](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/)2 or [WildTrax](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home), can then be used to further [classify](#image_classification) the [MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) image files by human observers (see Greenberg [2020] for a primer). [WildTrax](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home) automatically uses Megadetector to filter out blank images when data is uploaded to the platform. Some software can incorporate the outputs from Megadetector for species identification (e.g., [Timelapse](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/)2 [Greenberg, 2018]).\n",
