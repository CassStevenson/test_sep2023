    "A [study area](#study_area) is a unique area(s) within a [project](#project). There may be multiple [study areas](#study_area) within a larger [study area](#study_area). Aspects to consider when identifying the [study area](#study_area) include the spatial extent (and method of delineation), shape (Foster & Harmsen, 2012), and composition and configuration of features within it (including habitat types, land uses and disturbances).\n",

    "For example, [density](#density) models using the [capture-recapture (CR)](#mods_cr_cmr) [modelling approach](#mods_modelling_approach) requires that the [study area](#study_area) encompasses the entire area in which individuals can move during the [survey](#survey) and that each individual can be detected by a camera (Karanth & Nichols, 1998). In this case, the animal’s home range size could be used (e.g., four times the home range size [Maffei & Noss, 2008]) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017) in combination with a finite number of cameras available (e.g., 20 cameras are available; ideally, they should be [paired](#sampledesign_paired) and there should be \\> 4 cameras in each home range [Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017]) to define the [project](#project)’s spatial extent.\n",

There are many species-specific characteristics (e.g., body size, behaviour, rarity, etc.) and environmental factors (e.g., vegetation cover, snow depth) that influence the [detection probability](#detection_probability) and probability of occurrence of a species, as well as the size of the area that should be surveyed (e.g., Becker et al., 2022; Hofmeester et al., 2019; Iknayan et al., 2014; Steenweg et al., 2019).

There are five commonly used study designs in camera studies: [simple random](#sampledesign_random), [systematic random](#sampledesign_systematic_random) (grid), [stratified random](#sampledesign_stratified_random), [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) (including [paired design](#sampledesign_paired)) and [targeted](#sampledesign_targeted) (or opportunistic) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer 2017). A [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) study design is also used when it is impractical to use another design. Sampling design can occur hierarchically, where one approach is used at a larger scale (i.e., to select grids to place cameras within), and another approach is used at a smaller scale (i.e., to select the location within each grid to place the camera). Refer to the following literature for additional recommendations on study design: Burton et al., 2015; Cusack et al., 2015; Fisher & Burton, 2012; Kolowski and Forrester, 2017; Meek et al., 2014b; O’Connell et al., 2011b; Rovero et al., 2013; Steenweg et al., 2015; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017 and WildCAM’s [\"sampling design & effort section section\"](https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/) of their resource library (<https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/>).\n",

A [random design](#sampledesign_random) may help reduce biases that arise from selecting [camera locations](#camera_location) deliberately. It may also allow the user to make inferences about areas that were not surveyed when employing use-based approaches (e.g. [occupancy models](#mods_occupancy) [MacKenzie et al., 2002]; [intensity of use](#intensity_of_use) methods [Keim et al., 2019]).

This method is similar to the [simple random](#sampledesign_random) design. The same advantages apply in terms of unbiased landscape representation, and the same [modelling approaches](#mods_modelling_approach) can be used. The disadvantage of using a [systematic random](#sampledesign_systematic_random) (or [simple random](#sampledesign_random) design) is that rare habitat types may be missed.\n",

The [study area](#study_area) is divided into land-use regions based on land-use type, then into landscape units, which are assessed for environmental variability to determine where [sample stations](#sample_station) should be placed (Bayne et al., 2022). The “Before-After” component of BADR incorporates the phase of stressors (i.e., proposed or current development) (Bayne et al., 2022). The “Dose-Response” component of BADR controls for the variable distribution of activity (and the potential impacts) by incorporating control (or reference) [sample stations](#sample_station) and/or by placing cameras in [sample stations](#sample_station) along a gradient of disturbance (Bayne et al., 2022).\n",

This design can help ensure that the sample adequately reflects the major or uncommon strata of interest and may be an efficient approach when users are limited by accessibility constraints (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). This design can also be used to increase precision if animal densities are known to be highly variable (Junker et al., 2021) or when a species is expected to occur in certain habitat types more often (Gillespie et al., 2015).

    "[Appendix A - Table A2](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a2) shows the recommended minimum number of cameras according to the [Survey Objectives](#survey_objectives) and [modelling approach](#mods_modelling_approach). The optimal number of cameras required will be influenced by factors such as landscape heterogeneity, [survey](#survey) duration and spatial scale, species rarity and desired level of precision (Colyn et al., 2018; Rovero et al., 2013). For example, Kays et al. (2020) found that 25–35 cameras were needed for precise estimates of species richness, depending on the spatial scale of the [survey](#survey) and landscape diversity. The number of cameras required for precise estimates of [occupancy](#occupancy) was highly sensitive to the occurrence rate of species, with \\<20 cameras required for common species and \\>150 cameras required for rare species (Kays et al., 2020). In general, deploying more cameras and/or for longer durations always results in more precise estimates; however, users can consider rotating cameras across multiple sites for shorter durations (if feasible). There are several useful references and applications available to help determine the optimal number of cameras for a [survey](#survey) (e.g., Efford & Boulanger, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the [objectives](#survey_objectives) and [modelling approach](#mods_modelling_approach) warrant, placing multiple cameras at a site (either on the same attachment point or nearby) can significantly increase the [detection probability](#detection_probability) of less common species (more than increasing the number of [camera days per camera location](#camera_days_per_camera_location); O’Connor et al., 2017; Pease & Holzmueller, 2016; Stokeld et al., 2016) or be useful for individual identification.\n",

    "A second related consideration in terms of [survey](#survey) effort is how long to [survey](#survey) (i.e., the number of “[camera days per camera location](#camera_days_per_camera_location)\") at each [camera location](#camera_location). Specifically, the number of [camera days per camera location](#camera_days_per_camera_location) is the number of days each camera was active and functioning during the period it was deployed (e.g., 24-hour periods or the difference in days between the [Deployment Start Date Time](#deployment_start_date_time) and the [Deployment End Date Time](#deployment_end_date_time) if there were no interruptions). It is important to consider how the [Survey Objectives](#survey_objectives) and [assumptions](#mods_modelling_assumption) of the chosen [modelling approach](#mods_modelling_approach) may influence this decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wearn and Glover-Kapfer (2017) suggested that for estimates of [density](#density), species richness, [relative abundance](#mods_relative_abundance) and [occupancy](#occupancy), each camera should remain active for a minimum of 30 camera days. Steenweg et al. (2019) found that increasing the number of [camera days per camera location](#camera_days_per_camera_location) improved the likelihood of detecting a change in [occupancy](#occupancy), but only when the [cumulative detection probability](#cumulative_det_probability) (i.e., “the probability of detecting a species at least once during the entire [survey](#survey)“ [Steenweg et al., 2019]) was below a certain threshold (\\<0.80). In other words, if cameras were deployed long enough to reach a [cumulative detection probability](#cumulative_det_probability) \\>0.8 for the [Target Species](#target_species) and [survey](#survey) period, there was no benefit to surveying longer at one [camera location](#camera_location) (Long et al., 2008; Steenweg et al., 2019) (see also [section 6.4.4](#TOC_surv_guidelines_species_rarity)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For measures of species richness or diversity, it is presumed that a camera is active long enough to detect rare species that may occur at a specific location (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). If this is not the case, the results will indicate that the species was not present when it was (i.e., a “false negative”). False negatives may also be problematic for other measures, such as [**relative abundance indices**](#mods_relative_abundance) (count data, with or without [zero-inflation](#mods_zero_inflation) and/or [overdispersion](#mods_overdispersion)), even if the model type used can account for [imperfect detection](#imperfect_detection) explicitly (e.g., combined occurrence/[relative abundance](#mods_relative_abundance); [N-mixture models](#mods_n_mixture)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability in sampling effort amongst cameras can be accounted for in many approaches (e.g., for count data, an \"offset\" can be used to convert the count to a rate per unit time while still abiding by the [assumptions](#mods_modelling_assumption) of count-distributed data [Gallo et al., 2022; Moll et al., 2020]).\n",

    "The [**total number of camera days**](#total_number_of_camera_days) is the number of days that all cameras were active during the [survey](#survey). [Appendix A - Table A2](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a2) provides recommendations on the minimum number of [total number of camera days](#total_number_of_camera_days).\n",

    "An adequate sample size (in terms of the [total number of camera days](#total_number_of_camera_days)) in multiple seasons is often required to capture seasonal variation in [occupancy](#occupancy) or [detection rates](#detection_rate). As a general guideline, Kays et al. (2020) recommended that cameras run for 3-5 weeks across 40-60 sites per array and that small-scale variation in [detection probability](#detection_probability) across sites (e.g., microhabitats) should be accounted for in subsequent statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Becker et al. (2022) evaluated how the [effective detection distance](#effective_detection_distance) of cameras changed across species, habitat type and season. [Effective detection distance](#effective_detection_distance) refers to the distance from a camera that would give the same number of detections if all animals up to that distance are perfectly detected, and no animals that are farther away are detected; Buckland [1987], Becker et al. [2022]). In general, deploying more cameras and/or for longer durations always resulted in more precise estimates (Becker et al., 2022).\n",

    "Species' rarity can influence the ideal number of cameras and [survey](#survey) length (Chatterjee et al., 2021) (see also [section 6.4.2](#TOC_surv_guidelines_survey_effort_camera_days_per_camera_location)). Low [detection probability](#detection_probability) of rare or cryptic species can result in imprecise estimates if there are too few cameras or if cameras are not deployed for long enough (e.g., Steenweg et al. 2019). Chatterjee et al. (2021) suggested that for [occupancy models](#mods_occupancy) (MacKenzie et al., 2002) of common species, to survey a minimum of 50 sites for 15–20 days. For rare, elusive species, they recommended surveying 100 sites at a minimum for 20–30 days (Chatterjee et al., 2021).\n",

    "If a user must choose between more cameras *vs.* fewer cameras with longer [surveys](#survey), Chatterjee et al. (2021) suggested that for rare species, the optimal precision can be obtained by increasing the number of sites, whereas for common species, increasing the number of samples is more effective. For measuring species richness, Si et al. (2014) found that rotating cameras to new sites was more efficient than leaving cameras at fewer sites for longer periods. O'Connor et al. (2017) also recommended utilizing more cameras *vs*. increasing study length to increase [detection probabilities](#detection_probability). [Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR)](#mods_scr_secr); Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models were the only models shown to be quite robust to small camera quantities, with just spacing cameras farther out being a more efficient way to increase precision (Sollmann et al., 2012).\n",

    "In general, regardless of species and [objective](#survey_objectives), increasing the number of [survey](#survey) locations or the [survey](#survey) length improved precision (Chatterjee et al., 2021).

    "The season of the [survey](#survey) should be considered when designing a remote camera study. [Detection probability](#detection_probability) of species may vary seasonally due to changes in species movement rates, behaviour, use patterns, and vegetation growth. Certain species may not be detectable during certain times of year (e.g., hibernation or migration; Kays et al., 2020). Other species have seasonal activity patterns (e.g., birthing period, wet/dry seasons) that influence [detection probability](#detection_probability) and, thus, the data collected."
