    "An essential first step when designing any [survey](#survey) is to clearly define its [objectives](#survey_objectives). [Survey Objectives](#survey_objectives) should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (i.e., SMART). [Survey Objectives](#survey_objectives) should describe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Target Species](#target_species) - the species that the [survey](#survey) is designed to detect,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [State variable(s)](#state_variable) - a formal measure that summarizes the state of a community or population at a particular time (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017) (e.g., species richness or population abundance), and\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Proposed [modelling approach(es)](#mods_modelling_approach) - the method used to analyze the camera data, which should depend on the [state variable](#state_variable) (e.g., [occupancy models](#mods_occupancy) [MacKenzie et al., 2002], [spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models](#mods_scr_secr) [e.g., Royle et al., 2009] for [density](#density) estimation, etc.) and the [Target Species](#target_species). To learn more about the different [modelling approaches](#mods_modelling_approach), refer to [Appendix A - Table A1](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a1), [Appendix A - Table A2](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a2), and [WildCAM’s resource library](https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/).\n",

    "An example of a clearly defined [Survey Objective](#survey_objectives) could be “to monitor trends in wolverine [occupancy](#occupancy) at 5-year intervals from March – December 2020 to 2030 in wildlife management unit 539”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Survey Objective](#survey_objectives) will determine the appropriate [study design](#survey) and [deployment](#deployment) considerations (e.g., [camera spacing](#camera_spacing), [survey](#survey) effort, attractants or not). For example, based on the above objective for our wolverine [occupancy](#occupancy) [project](#project), we “randomly selected [camera locations](#camera_location) within a 15 km x 15 km grid cell with one camera per location and a total of 60 stations across our [study area](#study_area). We will place [lure](#baitlure_lure) dispensers at each [camera location](#camera_location) to increase the likelihood of detecting a wolverine.” to increase the likelihood of detecting a wolverine.”"
