    "Many aspect of site selection and study duration are often linked to the home range size of the [Target Species](#target_species); this is because many [modelling approaches](#mods_modelling_approach) (e.g. [occupancy models](#mods_occupancy) [{{ ref_intext_mackenzie_et_al_2004 }}] assume “site closure” (i.e., that there is no change in state (e.g. species presence/ absence, immigration/ emigration, births/deaths) during the [survey](#survey) period ({{ ref_intext_mackenzie_et_al_2004 }}). For some approaches, violation of the site closure [assumption](#mods_modelling_assumption) can result in an underestimate of [detection probabilities](#detection_probability) and, in turn, over-estimate [density](#density) (e.g., with spatial recapture models) or result in simply averaging detections over the sampling period (e.g., [REM](#mods_rem) [{{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2008 }}; {{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2013 }}], [REST](#mods_rest) [{{ ref_intext_nakashima_et_al_2017 }}] models). To meet the “site closure” [assumption](#mods_modelling_assumption), the study design might include spacing cameras far enough apart that the same individual is not detected at multiple sites (e.g., larger than the species' home range size); this is often referred to as “independent camera locations”. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [survey](#survey) duration must also be short enough that the probability of [occupancy](#occupancy) does not change (i.e., not confounded by other processes, e.g., by changes in the population) ({{ ref_intext_oconnell_et_al_2011 }}). \n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Home range size information should, ideally, be chosen to reflect the conditions of your study (as closely as possible). For example, using data on home range size from a study that only reported home range size for one season (e.g., summer home range size) might bias placement if your study aims to evaluate occupancy over the entire year if the species' movement is highly varies between seasons (e.g., moves more in summer).\n",
