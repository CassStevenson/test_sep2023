    "- **Small**: rodents and similarly sized species in the “Mustelidae” family [i.e., weasels, badgers, otters, martens, wolverine, etc.])\n",
    "- **Medium**:  small and mid-sized species, ~< 33 lbs (or 15 kilograms), such as meso-carnivores (i.e., Red, fox, Coyote) ({{ ref_intext_roemer_et_al_2009 }})\n",
    "- **Large**:  bears or ungulates (i.e., large mammals with hooves, such as White-tailed deer, Elk, Moose, etc)\n",
    "- **Multiple**:  *select this option if your study includes multiple Target Species that vary in body size.*\n",

    "Body size affects the detection process ({{ ref_intext_obrien_et_al_2011 }}). Species with a larger body size are more likely to be detected; and therefore may require lower sampling effort than smaller species ({{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}). Larger species moving through the camera’s detection zone are more likely to trigger the camera ({{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}; {{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{ ref_intext_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}); they can also be detected farther away or occur at wider angles ({{ ref_intext_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{{ ref_intext_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}). Whereas, small mammals are often undetected due to their small size (({{ ref_intext_obrien_et_al_2011 }}; {{ ref_intext_anile_devillard_2016 }}) and because “small species which routinely move at fast speeds, such as stoats and weasels, are likely to have especially small detection zones” ({{ ref_intext_glen_et_al_2013 }}).\n",

Error bars show standard deviation. Body mass values come from North Carolina animals in the mammal collections of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences\n",
    "When thinking beyond the camera's FOV, larger species generally also have larger home ranges {{ ref_intext_garland_et_al_1983 }} and daily movement distances, making them more likely to be detected at multiple cameras {{ ref_intext_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}, therefore there are also implications for which models may be appropriate (due to assumptions of “site closure” / “independent locations”).\n",
