# 10.0 Data management

Data management is a critical component of any [project](#project). Below are recommendations on file naming conventions and file structure to help manage remote camera data. Refer to the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC et al., 2024) for additional information topics related to data management, including software platforms and tools to help camera users enter [metadata](#metadata) as well as store, process and analyze image data.

(TOC_md_standards_naming_conventions)=
## 10.1 Naming conventions

It is highly recommended that users develop a set of naming conventions prior to entering data. Using naming conventions will minimize the risk of having images from different [deployments](#deployment), [study areas](#study_area), or [surveys](#survey) with the same name. Note that many [metadata](#metadata)/data repositories (e.g., [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) [RISC, 2019], [Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jg-WybmVeGlWGrbPpwuwJCgranOV1r3M_LrzELttfK0/edit#gid=412365965) [Ahumada et al., 2019], [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca)) have required field formats and special character limitations.

Naming conventions are especially important for the following fields:

-   [Project Name](#project_name)

-   [Study Area Name](#study_area_name)

-   [Survey Name](#survey_name)

-   [Sample Station Name](#sample_station_name)

-   [Camera Location Name](#camera_location_name)

-   [Deployment Name](#deployment_name)

-   [Image Name](#image_name)

-   [Sequence Name](#sequence_name)

-   Camera ID

-   Animal ID

Refer to the [Special characters section](#TOC_md_standards_allowable_formats_special_characters), as well as [Appendix A - Table A2](/2_metadata-standards/2_13.0_AppendixA.md#TOC_md_standards_table_a2) for examples of recommended naming conventions.

(#TOC_md_standards_allowable_formats_special_characters)=
(TOC_md_standards_allowable_formats_special_characters)=
## 10.1.1 Allowable formats & Special characters

IDs (i.e., “Name” or “ID” field listed above) and file names should not have spaces or leading zeros. Additional restrictions on special characters are as follows:

-   **Supported special characters**: - \_ :
-   **Special characters NOT supported**: , . / ( ) [ ] & \# \@ space

Alternative naming conventions may be used, but the goal should be to minimize duplication of IDs (and/or file names). Note that if you plan to use Timelapse2 (Greenberg, 2018), special characters for alphanumeric fields are further restricted to letters, numbers, “\_”, and “-“.

(TOC_md_standards_renaming_images)=
### 10.1.2 Renaming images

If you wish to rename your images, it is highly recommended that renamed images reflect the associated [Image Name](#image_name).

Data entry software can be used for batch processing of image names, which can significantly reduce data processing time compared to renaming images manually (e.g., [Timelapse2](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) [Greenberg, 2018], [Reconyx MapView](http://www.reconyx.com/software/mapview;) [Reconyx, Holmen, WI, USA]) or other tools (e.g., [WildCo Lab's Image Renamer](https://github.com/WildCoLab/WildCo_Image_Renamer) [WildCo Lab, 2021b]). Note that it is not always necessary to rename images. For example, renaming would not be required if data are stored in a folder structure that identifies the [camera location](#camera_location) and the [survey](#survey) from which it was collected.

(TOC_md_standards_file_structure)=
## 10.2 File structure

Image data ideally should be stored in a hierarchical structure as shown in ([Figure 1](/2_metadata-standards/2_3.0_Metadata-Standards.md#TOC_md_standards_fig_1)). Each level would typically comprise a series of file subfolders containing data from the level below it (e.g., a [project](#project) folder with study area subfolders, with each [study area](#study_area) with [survey](#survey) subfolders etc.). For example, [Figure 2](#TOC_md_standards_fig_2) shows the file structure for a [project](#project) that consisted of two [study areas](#study_area), each with one [survey](#survey) and each [survey](#survey) with two [camera locations](#camera_location) with one [deployment](#deployment) period and two sequences per [camera location](#camera_location).

However, this is often not the way we store this information in the form of CSVs (e.g., if there are only one or two [study areas](#study_area), it might not make sense to store this information in a separate CSV file). These [metadata](#metadata) standards suggest a CSV structure similar to that of other [metadata](#metadata)/data repositories (e.g., [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) [RISC, 2019], [Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jg-WybmVeGlWGrbPpwuwJCgranOV1r3M_LrzELttfK0/edit#gid=412365965) [Ahumada et al., 2019], [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca)) that consists of four CSVs associated with these [metadata](#metadata) standards:

-   Project CSV

-   Sample Station/Camera Location CSV

-   Deployment CSV

-   Image/Sequence CSV (includes Event Type = "Tag")

The information from each CSV can be linked using identifiers for each of the levels in the folder structure/hierarchy (refer to [Figure 3](#TOC_md_standards_fig_3)) so that redundant information does not need to be repeated, and the chance of error is reduced. The connections between the levels and CSVs are also outlined in [Appendix A - Table A2](/2_metadata-standards/2_13.0_AppendixA.md#TOC_md_standards_table_a2).

Refer to the [Remote Camera Metadata Standards: Metadata Template v3](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC, 2024) for the template CSVs and additional information.

(TOC_md_standards_data_storage_archival)=
## 10.5 Data storage (archival)

It is strongly encouraged/may be required that remote camera datasets are submitted to an open data repository. There are regulatory requirements to submit data loadforms to the [FWMIS database](https://www.alberta.ca/fisheries-and-wildlife-management-information-system-overview.aspx) (not images, although this is strongly encouraged) according to specific policies (e.g., Sensitive Species Inventory Protocols, Research and Collection permits, etc.). A new FWMIS loadform consistent with these [metadata](#metadata) standards will be available in August 2023. Refer to the Government of Alberta web pages for further information.

There are other cloud or server-based repositories available to house all camera datasets, including <http://www.wildtrax.ca/>[WildTrax](http://www.wildtrax.ca/), [eMammal](https://emammal.si.edu/) (McShea et al., 2015), <https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/>[Wildlife Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) (Ahumada et al., 2019) and others (see Young et al., [2018] for a comparison of 12 available programs for the management of camera data).

All data, including the images, [deployment area photos](#deployment_area_photos) and complete metadata, can be uploaded and stored in the [WildTrax repository](http://www.wildtrax.ca). [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca) has multiple privacy options and can accommodate all categories of images that users may prefer to manage separately, including “[false trigger](#false_trigger)” and images of humans.

[Appendix 1 - Table A1](/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.md#TOC_surv_guidelines_table_a1) contains a crosswalk table linking the data fields from these Alberta Metadata Standards with those from the [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) (RISC, 2019), FWMIS, [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca) and [Wildlife Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) (Ahumada et al., 2019) data repositories.

Refer to the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC et al., 2024) for more information on data storage.
