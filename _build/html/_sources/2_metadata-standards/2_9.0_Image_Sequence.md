# 9.0 Image/Sequence

The **image/[sequence](#sequence) level** provides information on the data for an image (individual photo) or [sequence](#sequence) of related images (e.g., images that are grouped as part of the same trigger "event").

An **image** may be part of a multi-image [sequence](#sequence).

A [**sequence**](#sequence) refers to a user-defined group of images or video clips that denote a single "[detection event](#detection_event)". Often camera users choose a certain time threshold (or “[inter-detection interval](#inter_detection_interval)”) to define independent [detection events](#detection_event); (e.g., 30 minutes (O'Brien et al., 2003; Gerber et al., 2010; Kitamura et al., 2010; Samejima et al., 2012) or 1 hour (e.g., Tobler et al., 2008; Rovero and Marshall, 2009)). This threshold should be recorded in the [Survey Design Description](#survey_design_description) field, if applicable.

When a [Sequence](#sequence) [Event Type](#event_type) is used, only enter data once for the [sequence](#sequence) of images (not for each unique image) and use the first image of the [sequence](#sequence) as the [Sequence Name](#sequence_name), as this is the time of the first detection.

Refer to the [Data Management section](/2_metadata-standards/2_10.0_Data-Management.md#TOC_md_standards_data_management) for information on [image processing](#image_processing) software, and recommendations on data file structure and naming conventions.

(TOC_md_standards_image_name)=
## 9.1 Image Name

A unique alphanumeric identifier for the image. It is highly recommended that users develop a photo naming convention prior to entering data. It is important to include (at a minimum) the [camera location](#camera_location), date, time, and image number when generating an [Image Name](#image_name) to avoid duplicate file names. For example, the [Deployment Name](#deployment_name) and image number would not be unique for the same [deployment](#deployment) within Reconyx overflow file subfolders (i.e., when the number of images exceeds 9,999, another folder is created [e.g., 101MEDIA] and the numbers in the image file names begin again at img_001).

We recommend using either of the following naming conventions for [Image Names](#image_name):

1.  "[Deployment Name](#deployment_name)"\_*"*[Camera_Serial Number](#camera_serial_number)*"\_*"[Image_Sequence_Date_Time](#image_sequence_date_time)"\_"Image Number" (e.g., "bh1_17-Jul-2018_P900FF04152022_22-Jul-2018_10:34:22_img_100"), or
2.  "[Deployment Name](#deployment_name)"\_*"*[Image_Sequence_Date_Time](#image_sequence_date_time)*"\_*"Image Number" (e.g., "bh1_17-Jul-2018_22-Jul-2018_10:34:22_img_100")

The file name used to create the [Image Name](#image_name) should ideally match the file name of the original image.

(TOC_md_standards_sequence_name)=
## 9.2 Sequence Name

A unique alphanumeric identifier for a multi-image [sequence](#sequence).

The [**Sequence Name**](#sequence_name) should ideally consist of the [Deployment Name](#deployment_name) and the names of the first and last images and videos in the [sequence](#sequence) (separated by "") (i.e., "[Deployment Name](#deployment_name)"\_"img\_#[name of first image in [sequence](#sequence)]"\_"img#[name of last image in [sequence](#sequence)]." For example, if a particular [sequence](#sequence) contains five images, the [Sequence Name](#sequence_name) might be "bh1_22-Jul-2018_img_001-img_005." If "img\_ " prefixes are used to create the [Sequence Name](#sequence_name), they ideally should match the names of the original photos. Leave blank if not applicable.

Even though the first image of a [sequence](#sequence) is the only image used to derive the [Sequence Name](#sequence_name), the remaining images typically also include useful information (e.g., images of all individuals in a group). Therefore, it is ideal to archive all of the images from a [sequence](#sequence). If it is not possible to submit all of the images, users should ideally submit the image(s) from a [sequence](#sequence) that best represents the [sequence](#sequence) (e.g., those that can be used to verify the [Species](#species) and [Individual Count](#individual_count)).

(TOC_md_standards_image_sequence_date_time)=
## 9.3 Image/Sequence Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)

The date and time of an image, or the image chosen to represent the [sequence](#sequence), recorded as "DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS" (e.g., 22-Jan-2018 12:00:02).

[Sequence](#sequence) date/time information may be reported for a "representative image" of a [sequence](#sequence) (i.e., the image with the most information). For example, if three images were included in a [sequence](#sequence), but the [Sex Class](#sex_class) could only be discerned in the second image [all else remaining equal], the second image would be the best representative image of the [sequence](#sequence).

The [Image/Sequence Date Time](#image_sequence_date_time) differs from the [Image Set Start Date Time](#image_set_start_date_time) which refers to the **first** image or video collected during a [deployment](#deployment).

(TOC_md_standards_analyst)=
## 9.4 Analyst

The first and last names of the individual who provided the observation data point ([Species](#species) identification and associated information). If there are multiple [Analysts](#analyst) for an observation, enter the primary [Analyst](#analyst).

(TOC_md_standards_species)=
## 9.5 Species

The common name of the [Species](#species) being categorized ("tagged") in the [tag](#tag), image or [sequence](#sequence) (e.g., "coyote" or "common goldeneye"). If there is more than one wildlife [Species](#species) present in an image/[sequence](#sequence), data for each [Species](#species) should be entered on a unique row but with the same [Image Name](#image_name) or [Sequence Name](#sequence_name) (reporting as [Event Type](#event_type) = "[Tag](#tag)").

For detections where you are unsure of the specific [Species](#species), report the level of lowest taxonomic ranking known (e.g., "class," "order," "family," "genus"), followed by the scientific name of the taxa.

For example, for a detection of an individual that is in the Canidae family, but for which the genus or [Species](#species) or unclear, report "family canidae." Refer to the species_crosswalk tab of the [Remote Camera Metadata Standards: Metadata Template v3](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC, 2024) for ease of reference.

If no [Species](#species) is present (i.e. blank or empty image), enter "none."

(TOC_md_standards_individual_count)=
## 9.6 Individual Count

The number of unique individuals being categorized. Depending on the [Event Type](#event_type), this may be recorded as the total number of individuals, or according to [Age Class](#age_class) and/or [Sex Class](#sex_class).

(#TOC_md_standards_age_class_and_sex_class)=
(TOC_md_standards_age_class_and_sex_class)=
## 9.7 Age Class and Sex Class

The age and sex classification of an individual(s) being categorized.

Select one [Age Class](#age_class) from the following:

-   **"Adult"** (animals that are old enough to breed; reproductively mature)

-   **"Juvenile"** (animals in their first summer, with clearly juvenile features (e.g., spots); mammals older than neonates but that still require parental care)

-   **"Subadult"** (animals older than a "Juvenile" but not yet an "Adult"; a "Subadult" may be further classified into "Young of the Year" or "Yearling")

-   **"Subadult - Young of Year"** (animals less than one year old; born in the previous year's spring, but has not yet lived through a winter season; between "Juvenile" and "Yearling")

-   **"Subadult - Yearling"** (animals approximately one year old; has lived through one winter season; between "Young of Year" and "Adult")

-   **"Unknown"**

Select one [Sex Class](#sex_class) from the following:

-   **"Male"**
-   **"Female"**
-   **"Unknown"**

If there is more than one [Age Class](#age_class) or [Sex Class](#sex_class) in an image/[sequence](#sequence), users can enter either:

1.  each unique [Age Class](#age_class)/[Sex Class](#sex_class) combination as a unique row ([Event Type](#event_type) = "Image" or "[Sequence](#sequence)" or
2.  each unique combination within the same row under an appropriate field ([Event Type](#event_type) = "[Tag](#tag)")

For example, if an image/[sequence](#sequence) contains 6 elk, 2 of which are [adult](#age_class_adult) females, 3 of which are [juveniles](#age_class_juvenile) of unknown sex and one of which is an [adult](#age_class_adult) male, the data could be entered as 3 unique rows, each with the same [Image/Sequence Date Time)](#image_sequence_date_time) and unique identifier ([Image Name](#image_name) or [Sequence Name](#sequence_name)), where:

-   the first row: Count = 2, [Age Class](#age_class) = [Adult](#age_class_adult), and [Sex Class](#sex_class) = Female
-   a second row: Count = 3, [Age Class](#age_class) = [Juvenile](#age_class_juvenile), and [Sex Class](#sex_class) = Unknown
-   a third row is Count = 1, [Age Class](#age_class) = [Adult](#age_class_adult), and [Sex Class](#sex_class) = Male

Alternatively, the same data could be entered in one single row as:

-   Count = 6, [Age Class](#age_class) = Blank, [Sex Class](#sex_class) = Blank, [Adult](#age_class_adult) Males = 1, [Adult](#age_class_adult) Females = 2, and [Juvenile](#age_class_juvenile) - Unclassified Sex = 3.

Deciding how to enter the data is at the user's discretion. However, the recommended approach to entering data where unique individuals are identified (or the [Behaviours](#behaviour) of individuals are identified) is to enter data for each individual as a unique row.

(TOC_md_standards_behaviour)=
## 9.8 Behaviour (optional)

The [Behaviour](#behaviour) of the individual(s) being categorized.

Select **one** of the options from the list provided:

-   **"Travelling"**

-   **"Standing"**

-   **"Running"**

-   **"Bedding"**

-   **"Drinking"**

-   **"Feeding/Foraging"**

-   **"Territorial Display"**

-   **"Rutting/Mating"**

-   **"Vigilant"**

-   **"Inspecting Camera"**

-   **"Inspecting (Non-specified)"**

-   **"Unknown"**

-   **"Other§"** (describe in [Image/Sequence Comments](#image_sequence_comments) field)

-   **"Multiple§"** (describe in [Image/Sequence Comments](#image_sequence_comments) field; e.g.,"[Behaviour](#behaviour)[Standing,Vigilant]")

-   **"Unknown"** (not applicable or did not collect)

If observing a group of individuals, record the Behaviour of all the individuals in the group or enter the Behaviour of each animal as a unique row (see example in the [Age Class and Sex Class section](#TOC_md_standards_age_class_and_sex_class) above).

If an animal is performing multiple [Behaviours](#behaviour), select "Multiple§," and include all the [Behaviours](#behaviour) in the [Image/Sequence Comments](#image_sequence_comments) as a comma delimited list. To help parse out this information later most easily, we recommend using a format that includes a header followed by the [Behaviour](#behaviour)(s), e.g., "[Behaviour](#behaviour)[Inspecting Camera,Travelling]."

(TOC_md_standards_animal_id)=
## 9.9 Animal ID (optional)

A unique ID for an animal that can be uniquely identified (e.g., marked in some way). If multiple unique individuals are identified, enter an [Animal ID](#animal_id) for each as a unique row. Leave blank if not applicable.

(TOC_md_standards_human_transport_mode_activity)=
## 9.10 Human Transport Mode/Activity (optional)

The activity performed, or mode of transportation used, by a human observed (e.g., hiker, skier, off-highway vehicle, etc.). This categorical field should be populated when data on humans (in addition to wildlife) are collected.

Select **one** of the options from the list provided:

-   **"Activity - Walking"**

-   **"Activity - Hiking"** (e.g., backpacker)

-   **"Activity - Running"**

-   **"Activity - Cycling"** (e.g., non-motorized or e-bike)

-   **"Activity - Skiing"**

-   **"Activity - Snowshoeing"**

-   **"Activity- Fishing"**

-   **"Activity - Hunting"**

-   **"Activity - Unspecified"**

-   **"Transport - Horse/Mule"**

-   **"Transport - Off-Highway Vehicle"** (e.g., all-terrain vehicle, snowmobile, motorbike, snowmobile, 4 x 4 truck)

-   **"Transport - Passenger Vehicle"** (e.g., car, truck without 4x4)

-   **"Transport - Large Commercial Vehicle/Heavy Equipment"** (e.g., logging truck, semi-truck, bus)

-   **"Transport - Unspecified"**

-   **"Activity/Transport - Other§"** (describe in [Image/Sequence Comments](#image_sequence_comments) field)

-   **"Unknown"** (not applicable)

Where there are multiple individuals and transport modes within a tag, image, or [sequence](#sequence), enter the data for each individual mode as a unique row. Leave blank if not applicable and record "Unknown" if not known.

(TOC_md_standards_image_sequence_comments)=
## 9.11 Image/Sequence Comments (optional)

Describe any additional data about the image or [sequence](#sequence).

If you selected the "Multiple§" option from the [Behaviour](#behaviour) field, enter all the [Behaviours](#behaviour) here (e.g., "[Behaviour](#behaviour)[Inspecting Camera,Travelling]")

(TOC_md_standards_image_trigger_mode)=
## 9.12 Image Trigger Mode (optional)

The type of [Trigger Mode](#settings_trigger_modes) used to capture the image as reported in the image Exif data. This field is categorical; record "Unknown" if not known.

Data should be entered as **one** of the following:

-   **"Motion Detection"**

-   **"Time Lapse"**

-   **"CodeLoc Not Entered"**

-   **"External Sensor"**

-   **"Unknown"**

(TOC_md_standards_image_sequence)=
## 9.13 Image Sequence (optional)

The order of the image in a rapid-fire [sequence](#sequence) as reported in the image Exif data (text; e.g., "1 of 1" or "1 of 3"). This field is in text format; leave blank if not applicable.

(TOC_md_standards_image_infrared_illuminator)=
## 9.14 Image Infrared Illuminator (optional)

The [Image Infrared Illuminator](#image_infrared_illuminator) is an image metadata field indicating whether the infrared illuminator setting was enabled (if applicable; to obtain greater visibility at night by producing infrared light). Record as reported in the image Exif data (e.g., "On" or "Off"). This field is categorical; leave blank if not applicable and record "Unknown" if not known.

Data should be entered as **one** of the following:

-   **"On"**

-   **"Off"**

-   **"Unknown"**

(TOC_md_standards_image_flash_output)=
## 9.15 Image Flash Output (optional)

The [Image Flash Output](#image_flash_output) is an image metadata field indicating the level of intensity of the flash [if enabled/applicable]). Record as reported in the image Exif data (e.g., "Flash Did Not Fire", "Auto"). This field is in text format; record "Unknown" if not known; leave blank if not applicable.
