Of all the modelling frameworks discussed in this document, capture-recapture (CR) also called capture-mark-recapture or mark-recapture – is perhaps the most wellknown. Since the 19th century, CR has been used to measure population size by  capturing, marking, releasing and recapturing individuals ({{ ref_intext_lecren_1965 }}, {{ ref_intext_otis_et_al_1978 }}). For species or populations that are challenging to physically trap and mark, CR  can also be applied to DNA, acoustic and camera trap data ({{ ref_intext_royle_et_al_2014 }}). Here,  we will discuss camera trap CR.

**Clarke et al. (2023) – Fig. 11** Adapted from Royle (2020). A detection history matrix for an example population. For each individual (1 through *𝑛*) during each sampling occasion (1 through *𝐾*), a value of 1 is assigned if that individual was detected at a camera trap and a value of 0 is assigned if it was not detected at a camera trap. Note that we do not detect individuals *𝑛* + 1, *𝑛* + 2…*𝑁* (0s for every sampling occasion), but they are still present and able to be detected.
:::

To estimate density using camera trap CR, we must first estimate population size *𝑁*. CR models use individuals’ detection histories – that is, the record of when each individual was photographed or not photographed (i.e., (re)captured or not (re)captured) – to solve for *𝑁* (Figure 3; Royle, 2020). Population-level detection histories look like a matrix of 1s and 0s, where 1s signify that an individual was captured during a given sampling occasion *𝑘*, and 0s signify that the individual was not captured during that occasion ({{ ref_intext_royle_2020 }}, {{ ref_intext_royle_et_al_2014 }}). The number of individuals photographed at least once over the course of the study (i.e., the count of animals captured) is *𝑛*.  

Importantly, the count of animals is not the same as the size of the population (i.e., *𝑛* ≠ *𝑁*). Some individuals will never be photographed during a study, even though they are present and able to be detected (i.e., they are in *𝑁* but not in *𝑛*; {{ ref_intext_royle_2020 }}). Using the matrix of detection histories, we must therefore calculate the likelihood animals will be detected by an array of camera traps – that is, detection probability *p* ({{ ref_intext_royle_2020 }}). 

Taking this information together, we can calculate population size *𝑁* as:

:::

which is often referred to as the canonical estimator of population size ({{ ref_intext_royle_2020 }}). Population size *𝑁* can then be divided by an estimate of the area of the sampling frame *𝐴* to obtain density. 

CR models have important limitations – notably that they do not consider the spatial configuration of camera traps or the spatial pattern of animal detections. This gives rise to two major issues: 

1. The sampling frame *𝐴* is not known ({{ ref_intext_chandler_royle_2013 }}). In other words: the true area animals occupy is never measured, only approximated using adhoc approaches (e.g., using a buffer strip around the trap array; {{ ref_intext_rich_et_al_2014 }}, {{ ref_intext_sollmann_2018 }}). Consequently, density cannot be calculated explicitly ({{ ref_intext_chandler_royle_2013 }}), and CR-derived density estimates are somewhat arbitrary and difficult to compare across studies ({{ ref_intext_green_et_al_2020 }}, {{ ref_intext_royle_et_al_2014 }}, {{ ref_intext_sollmann_2018 }}).

2. Detection probability is assumed to be the same across all individuals and sampling occasions, even though the likelihood a given individual is detected at a given camera trap will change with its proximity to that trap. An animal that occupies territory far away from a trap is less likely to be detected there than one that lives nearby, for example ({{ ref_intext_morin_et_al_2022 }}). 

The standard CR model has largely been phased out with the advent of spatially-explicit CR models (see {bdg-link-primary-line}`Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) / Spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR)<https://ab-rcsc.github.io/rc-decision-support-tool_concept-library/02_dialog-boxes/03_11_mod_scr_secr.html>`); {{ ref_intext_burton_et_al_2015 }}, {{ ref_intext_sollmann_2018 }}), which address the shortcomings of CR and have been shown to produce more accurate density estimates (e.g., {{ ref_intext_blanc_et_al_2013 }}, {{ ref_intext_obbard_et_al_2010 }}, {{ ref_intext_sollmann_et_al_2011 }}).

For each individual (1 through *𝑛*) during each sampling occasion (1 through *𝐾*), a value of 1 is assigned if that individual was detected at a camera trap and a value of 0 is assigned if it was not detected at a camera trap. Note that we do not detect individuals *𝑛* + 1, *𝑛* + 2…*𝑁* (0s for every sampling occasion), but they are still present and able to be detected.
