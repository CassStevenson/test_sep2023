# 6.0 Surveys

A [survey](#survey) is a unique [deployment](#deployment) period (temporal extent) within a [project](#project). There may be multiple surveys in a single [project](#project). However, if multiple [surveys](#survey) are completed in the same [study area](#study_area) and following the same [Survey Design](#survey_design) and methods of data collection, the [project](#project) and [survey](#survey) information may be the same. If a [project](#project) includes more than one type of [survey](#survey), each should be included separately, with a unique [Survey Name](#survey_name) and [survey](#survey)-specific information.

(TOC_md_standards_survey_name)=
## 6.1 Survey Name

A unique alphanumeric identifier for each [survey](#survey) period (e.g., "fortmc_1").

(TOC_md_standards_survey_objectives)=
## 6.2 Survey Objectives

Describe the specific objectives of each [survey](#survey) within a [project](#project), including the [Target Species](#target_species), and [state variables](#state_variable) (e.g., [occupancy](#occupancy), [density](#density)), and proposed [modelling approach(es)](#mods_modelling_approach). [Survey Objectives](#survey_objectives) should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (i.e., SMART).’

For example: "To monitor trends in wolf occupancy at 5-year intervals from January – December 2020 to 2023."

(TOC_md_standards_target_species)=
## 6.3 Target Species

The common name(s) of the species that the [survey](#survey) was designed to detect (e.g., "gray wolf").

If there is more than one [Target Species](#target_species), list the species in alphabetical order (e.g., "coyote, moose, mule deer”). Alternatively, use the genus common name where appropriate (e.g., "genus odocoileus" for mule and white-tailed deer).

(TOC_md_standards_survey_design)=
## 6.4 Survey Design

Survey Design refers to the spatial arrangement of remote cameras within the [study area](#study_area) for an individual survey. If “Hierarchical (multiple)\*” include additional details in the [Survey Design Description](#survey_design_description).

Note that we refer to different configurations of cameras more generally as study design and sampling design; however, the term “[*Survey Design*](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cjsteven_ualberta_ca/Documents/RCSC_RC-Survey-Guidelines_AB-Metadata-Standards/l)“ refers to study design as it applies to an individual [survey](#survey). There may be multiple [Survey Designs](#survey_design) for [survey](#survey) within a [project](#project); if this occurs, the [Survey Design](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cjsteven_ualberta_ca/Documents/RCSC_RC-Survey-Guidelines_AB-Metadata-Standards/l) should be reported separately for each [survey](#survey).

Select **one** of the [Survey Designs](#survey_design) from the list provided:

-   **"[Simple random](#sampledesign_random)”** (randomized [camera locations](#camera_location))

-   **"Systematic"** (regular pattern - e.g., grid; across disturbance gradient or reference sites)

-   **"[Stratified](#sampledesign_stratified)"** ([camera locations](#camera_location) in pre-defined "strata", e.g., habitat types)

-   **"[Clustered](#sampledesign_clustered)"** (multiple [camera locations](#camera_location) at a sample station; can be used with Systematic or [Stratified](#sampledesign_stratified) design)

-   **“[Paired](#sampledesign_paired)"** (two [camera locations](#camera_location) in close proximity to one another ("paired cameras"), or when one or more cameras are at two separate [camera locations](#camera_location) that are in close proximity or with some characteristics in common ("paired sites")
  
-   **"[Targeted](#sampledesign_targeted)"** ([camera locations](#camera_location) or [sample stations](#sample_station) with known or suspected high activity levels; e.g., game trails, mineral licks, etc.)

-   **"Convenience"** ([camera locations](#camera_location) or [sample stations](#sample_station) based on logistic considerations; e.g., remoteness, access constraints, and/or costs)

-   **"Hierarchical (Multiple)¶"** (e.g., [Systematic](#sampledesign_systematic) and [Stratified](#sampledesign_stratified); describe in [Survey Design Description](#survey_design_description))

-   **"Other¶"** (describe in [Survey Design Description](#survey_design_description))

-   **"Unknown"**

For additional information on [Survey Designs](#survey_design), refer to the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_0.1_Citation-and-Info.html) (RCSC et al., 2024).

(TOC_md_standards_survey_design_description)=
## 6.5 Survey Design Description (optional)

Describe any additional details about your [Survey Design](#survey_design).

If you selected the "Hierarchical (multiple)" option from the [Survey Design](#survey_design) list, report all the [Survey Designs](#survey_design) as a comma delimited list from larger to smaller spatial scales. To help parse out this information later most easily, we recommend using a format that includes a header followed by the various [Survey Designs](#survey_design), e.g., "[survey design](#survey_design)[[Systematic](#sampledesign_systematic),[Convenience](#sampledesign_convenience)]."

For example: "[survey_design](#survey_design)[[Systematic](#sampledesign_systematic),[Convenience](#sampledesign_convenience)]; one [camera location](#camera_location) within each township. Each location was within 100m of a secondary road or cutline. [Lure](#baitlure_lure) dispensers with Gorman's Gumbo (long line) were set-up at each [camera location](#camera_location) during initial camera [deployment](#deployment) and not revisited during the [survey](#survey) period."

If you selected the "Other" option from the [Survey Design](#survey_design) list, provide information about the design used.

If you set the [Event Type](#event_type) field to "[Sequence](#sequence)," and are using a user-defined time threshold (OR "[inter-detection interval](#inter_detection_interval)", e.g., 30 minutes) to define independent [detection "events"](#detection_event) within a [sequence](#sequence), report the [inter-detection interval](#inter_detection_interval) (or "sequence definition") in the [Survey Design Description](#survey_design_description). Refer to the [Image/Sequence section](/2_metadata-standards/2_9.0_Image_Sequence.md#TOC_md_standards_image_sequence) for further details.

(TOC_md_standards_event_type)=
## 6.6 Event Type

Report whether detections were reported as an individual image captured by the camera ("Image"), a "[Sequence](#sequence)," or "[Tag](#tag)".

A "[**tag**](#tag)" refers to when individuals, or groups of individuals, are categorized within an image, regardless of whether the information applies to all of the individuals in the image. A single [tag](#tag) is applied to categorize one or more individuals with the same combination of characteristics (e.g., [Adult](#age_class_adult) Males displaying the same [Behaviour](#behaviour)). Conversely, multiple [tags](#tag) are applied when individuals in an image differ in their characteristics (e.g., an [Adult](#age_class_adult) and a [Juvenile](#age_class_juvenile), all else remaining equal, are tagged separately). This could also occur for [Age Class](#age_class), [Behaviour](#behaviour), [Human Transport Mode/Activity](#human_transport_mode_activity), etc. Since multiple [tags](#tag) can occur for a single image, there may be multiple data rows for the same image (if the [Event Type](#event_type) is at the "[Tag](#tag)" level).
